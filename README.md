It's a Kaggle Comp of a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.

The dataset includes approximately 1.3 million transactions from 983 customers, providing for each of them the following information:

1. Name (first, last)

2. Gender (gender)

3. Job (job)

4. Date of Birth (dob)

5. Address (Street, City, State, Zip, Lat, Long)

6. City Population (city_pop)

7. Credit Card Number (cc_num)

Additionally, the dataset includes details about the transactions made by each customer, such as:

1. Date and Time (trans_date_trans_time)

2. Item Purchased (merchant, category)

3. Transaction Number (trans_num)

4. Transaction Timestamp Encoding (unix_time)

5. Merchantâ€™s Location (merch_lat, merch_long)

6. Fraud Indicator (is_fraud)
Objectives

The aim of this report is to develop and identify a reliable model capable of detecting illegitimate transactions
made by individuals using point-of-sale (P.O.S) systems. These fraudulent activities represent a small fraction
of all transactions, making them particularly challenging to identify. The focus will be on creating a robust and
accurate framework that can effectively handle the rarity of such events.
